# SfM_CPlus
Traditional SfM Implementation on C++ (Fun Project to refine C++ Skillset)


ToDo :

Implement the below by taking into account of creating a datastructure which can work with the final visibility matrix which helps to handle the optimization computation using sparsity 

- [ ] Implement Dataloader in C Plus - Can Ingest CSV files
- [ ] Implement feature detectors in C++ which can leverage GPU - SIFT.CPP 
- [ ] Implement RANSAC in C Plus 
- [ ] Implement Fundamental & essential matrix - CPP
- [ ] Implement Camera Pose Disambiguation
- [ ] Implement Camera Pose extraction
- [ ] Implement Linear Triangulation
- [ ] Implement Non Linear Triangulation
- [ ] Implement LinearPnP 
- [ ] Implement Non Linear PnP
- [ ] Implement PnP RANSAC
- [ ] Implement Visibility Matrix
- [ ] Implement Bundle Adjustment - Non Linear Whole Optimization
- [ ] Check any Non Linear Solvers - Optimized GPU based ones if possible 
- [ ] Give Support for both CPU and GPU Runs
- [ ] Add QT interfacing to load data and run
- [ ] Add Python bindings
- [ ] Connect NeRF to the Implementation from Qt
